TumorScan: Detecting Cancer with Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

TumorScan is a machine learning-based breast cancer classification model that utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on patient data. This project demonstrates the power of SVM for medical diagnosis by using real-world breast cancer datasets.
ðŸš€ Features

    Uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for high-accuracy classification.
    Preprocesses data, handles missing values, and normalizes features.
    Trains on real breast cancer data for practical applications.
    Provides detailed evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
    Saves the trained model for future predictions without retraining.
