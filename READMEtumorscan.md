🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! 🚀
This is a growing collection of hands-on projects where I apply various machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. The goal is to explore, implement, and refine machine learning models while improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.
📌 Projects Overview

#1️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction 🏥

    Objective: Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.
    Techniques Used:
        Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        Feature selection and scaling techniques
    Key Features: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, age, and other medical indicators.
    Next Steps:
        Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
        Experiment with deep learning models (Neural Networks).

2️⃣ IMDB Sentiment Analysis 🎬

    Objective: Classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative using machine learning.
    Techniques Used:
        Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words)
        Classification models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Key Features:
        Processing raw text data and extracting useful insights.
        Identifying sentiment polarity in movie reviews.
    Next Steps:
        Experiment with deep learning models such as LSTMs and Transformers (BERT).
        Improve text preprocessing with stop-word removal and stemming.

3️⃣ Customer Segmentation 🛍️

    Objective: Identify distinct customer groups based on shopping behaviors.
    Techniques Used:
        Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)
        Data scaling and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
    Key Features:
        Analyzing purchase frequency, spending habits, and customer demographics.
        Visualizing clusters using scatter plots and heatmaps.
    Next Steps:
        Test other clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
        Apply segmentation insights to real business use cases.

4️⃣ House Price Prediction 🏠

    Objective: Predict the price of houses based on various property attributes.
    Techniques Used:
        Supervised learning (Regression models)
        Feature engineering and outlier detection
    Models Tested:
        Linear Regression
        Decision Trees
        Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
    Key Features:
        Predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and other factors.
        Evaluating model performance using RMSE and R² score.
    Next Steps:
        Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
        Experiment with neural networks (ANNs) for price prediction.
