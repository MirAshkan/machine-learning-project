TumorScan: Detecting Cancer with Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

TumorScan is a machine learning-based breast cancer classification model that utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on patient data. This project demonstrates the power of SVM for medical diagnosis by using real-world breast cancer datasets.
🚀 Features

    Uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for high-accuracy classification.
    Preprocesses data, handles missing values, and normalizes features.
    Trains on real breast cancer data for practical applications.
    Provides detailed evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
    Saves the trained model for future predictions without retraining.
🛠 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Train the Model

Run the following script to train the SVM model and save it for later use:

python train.py

3️⃣ Make Predictions

Use the trained model to predict tumor type on new data:

python predict.py

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 10 numerical features representing different characteristics of cell samples. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).
🧠 Model Performance

    Accuracy: ~97%
    Precision & Recall: High values ensuring minimal false negatives, which is critical in medical applications.
    Confusion Matrix: Shows an effective separation between benign and malignant cases.
